```

Next, you will need to install the project dependencies using NPM

```bash
# switch into the project folder
$ cd myuse-starter-barra

# install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the below command for development mode. Development mode is useful because it will reload the application every time you make a change in the code:

```

Once the app is running, you can access view it in your browser at the below link:

- [Localhost](http://localhost:3000/)

You can also test how your application will perform in production, using the below commands:

```bash
# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Updating the Project

To download the latest changes from the repository, you can use the below command:

```bash
# download updates from server
$ git pull
```
